4.0 Fix Contents

WSP-1044

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, error occurs when the Secure
Network Communications (SNC) connection expires.

If the SNC mode is enabled for an RFC client connection and
the Minimum Pool Size parameter is set to 0, the following error
message appears in the error log when the connection expires:

'An error occurred while attempting to destroy connection
int_sap_adapter.connections:connNode_SAP0047(18)'.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1042

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, passwords in the text box appear
as cleartext.

When WmSAP public API services are invoked from the Integration
Server Administrator, all the passwords in the text box appear
as cleartext.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1039

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, the foreign language characters
appear as invalid characters.

The logging screen of SAP Adapter 7.1 displays the foreign
language characters as invalid characters. However, in the
Integration Server Administrator the same foreign language
characters appear in the valid format.
 
This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1034

In webMethods SAP Adapter, an error occurs when you click old log
files.

The following error message is displayed in Integration Server
Administrator when you click on old log files in SAP Adapter.

"Specified path does not match any log file path"

This issue is resolved.

WSP-1008 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, the return values of the
pub.sap.transport.BAPI:OutboundProcess service are not mappable.

After running the pub.sap.transport.BAPI:OutboundProcess
service, the return values in the $metabapi and $abapexection
documents are properly displayed but cannot be mapped to other
variables.

This issue is resolved. Now, all the return values of the
pub.sap.transport.BAPI:OutboundProcess service can be mapped to
other variables.

WSP-1007 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, when CSRF guard is enabled an
error occurs while trying to view transactions or use the
"Apply Filter" button.

The following error message is displayed in Integration Server
Administrator:
"Access Denied. Invalid CSRF secure token"

This issue is resolved. 

WSP-1005 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, the pub.sap.transaction:sweep
service can throw a NullPointerException.

When a thread in webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 is deleting
transactions while another thread is listing the content of
the transaction store, a race condition can occur which causes
a NullPointerException. The following error message is displayed
in the logs:

[SAP.110.9407] WmSAP Adapter: Error in transaction store:
java.lang.NullPointerException

This issue is resolved. The pub.sap.transaction:sweep service
does not throw NullPointerExceptions due to race conditions
anymore.

WSP-1003 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 Fix 11, the
pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument service does not copy empty
segments from inbound IDocs.

Since Fix 11, the pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument service does not
copy empty segments from inbound IDocs into the pipeline.
This may lead to mapping issues in certain use cases.

This issue is resolved. You must add the new watt property,
watt.sap.idoc.keepEmptySegments and set it to true to enable the
pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument service to copy empty segments from
inbound IDocs. 

WSP-1001 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 is not compatible with SAP JCo version
3.0.13 and higher.

Changes in the SAP JCo middleware version 3.0.13 cause exceptions
during the IDoc processing in SAP Adapter 7.1.

This issue is resolved. The adapter is now compatible with SAP
JCo version 3.0.13 and higher. 

WSP-1000 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, SNC enabled RFC connections
still use non-SNC connections for repository lookups.

SNC enabled RFC connections use non-SNC connections for
repository metadata lookups. This requires that the non-SNC
connections must be able to access the connected SAP system,
which can violate security guidelines.

This issue is resolved. Now, SNC enabled RFC connections only
use SNC repository connections for metadata lookups. 

WSP-999 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter, an error occurs when you click old log
files.

The following error message is displayed in Integration Server
Administrator when you click on old log files in SAP Adapter.

"Specified path does not match any log file path"

This issue is resolved.

WSP-998 (SAP_7.1_Fix14)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, running the
pub.sap.idoc:documentToIDoc service throws a NullPointerException
when the IDOCTYP information is missing in the IDoc control
record.

When running the pub.sap.idoc:documentToIDoc service to process
an IDoc package containing two or more IDocs where the IDOCTYP
information is not specified in the IDoc control record, the
SAP Adapter abruptly ends the service. The error log displays a
NullPointerException without an error message.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter returns a detailed
error message in the log when the IDOCTYP information is missing
in the IDoc control record. 

WSP-973 (SAP_7.1_Fix13)

A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue was discovered in Integration
Server Administrator during internal security testing.

This issue is resolved. 

WSP-972 (SAP_7.1_Fix13)

A path traversal issue was discovered in Integration Server
Administrator during internal security testing.

This issue is resolved.

WSP-965 (SAP_7.1_Fix13)

In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 Fix 11, empty segments in an
inbound IDoc are returned by the adapter as null objects.

When SAP sends an IDoc that contains an empty segment to
Integration Server, the adapter returns the empty segment as
a null object and not as an empty object.

This issue is resolved.

WSP-942 (SAP_7.1_Fix12)
Several cross-site scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in
Integration Server Administrator during internal security
testing.

This issue is resolved. 

WSP-941 (SAP_7.1_Fix12)
In webMethods SAP Adapter, a NullPointerException error occurs
in the Centralized Transaction Store(CTS) Server during a
transaction update.

When a CTS Client updates a deleted transaction before the
transaction is deleted from the CTS Server, SAP Adapter logs a
NullPointerException error in the logs files of CTS Client and
Server.

This issue is resolved. 

WSP-928 (SAP_7.1_Fix11)
webMethods SAP Adapter returns an “Access Denied” message when
using the CSRF guard feature in webMethods Integration Server.

Using SAP Adapter with the Integration Server Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) guard enabled results in an “Access Denied”
message when you attempt to:
- Disable an SAP Adapter RFC Listener in a “pending enabled”
state.
- View the details of a transaction on the SAP Adapter
Transactions screen by selecting the Transaction ID (TID) and
clicking a link in the Received Message Body section.

The issue is resolved. 

WSP-917 (SAP_7.1_Fix11)
webMethods SAP Adapter does not report an error back to the
sending SAP system when creating a new transaction entry fails.

When an error occurs during the creation of a new transaction
entry in the SAP Adapter transaction store for an incoming tRFC
request, the adapter does not report an error back to the sending
SAP system, which may lead to an incorrect state for the tRFC in
the SAP system.

The issue is resolved. SAP Adapter now reports the error back to
the sending SAP system when creating a new transaction entry
for an incoming tRFC fails.

WSP-915 (SAP_7.1_Fix11)
When using webMethods SAP Adapter ALE notifications, all IDoc
fields are available in the pipeline after the notification
document is published irrespective of the field selection
made at design time.

When configuring an SAP Adapter ALE notification in Designer, 
even when you select only some of the IDoc fields on the Request
Field Selection tab of the notification template, all fields are
present in the pipeline at run time.

The issue is resolved. You can use a new watt property,
watt.sap.notification.filterIDocFields, to enable filtering
of unselected IDoc fields.

Adapter Configuration Parameter Reference:
watt.sap.notification.filterIDocFields
Removes unselected IDoc fields from an adapter notification
in the pipeline at run time.
Values are:
- true. Removes unselected IDoc fields.
- false (default). Does not remove unselected IDoc
fields.

If no filtering of IDoc fields is required, Software AG
recommends keeping the default adapter behavior for better
performance.

Important! Filtering of IDoc control record fields may lead
to subsequent errors if the filtered IDoc is passed to IDoc
built-in adapter services.

WSP-899 (SAP_7.1_Fix10)
Integration Server sessions expire when the webMethods SAP
Adapter "watt.sap.listener.session.timeout" configuration
parameter is set to "0".

In SAP Adapter, when the "watt.sap.listener.session.timeout"
parameter is set to the default value of "0", which prevents
session timeout for RFC Listener sessions, the Integration
Server session pool becomes exhausted. The issue occurs
because the server does not terminate used sessions if the
timeout value is "0".

The issue is resolved. Integration Server now terminates
RFC Listener sessions when their session timeout is "0",
which prevents the exhaustion of the server's session pool.

WSP-895 (SAP_7.1_Fix10)
Accessing some webMethods SAP Adapter pages fails when CSRF
Guard is enabled in webMethods Integration Server.

When the CSRF Guard feature is enabled in Integration Server,
some of the SAP Adapter pages in Integration Server
Administrator are blocked with the error: "Access denied.
Invalid CSRF secure token."

This issue is resolved.

WSP-886 (SAP_7.1_Fix9)
webMethods SAP Adapter takes too much memory in the JVM heap
when multiple adapter listener threads and notifications are
active. 

When SAP Adapter checks if an active notification matches an
incoming request, the adapter may keep a reference to the request
pipeline content within the notification object, even if the
notification is not processing the request. This behavior may
cause a memory leak because no garbage collection occurs for
obsolete pipeline data, which can become critical when many
active listener threads are receiving documents and many
notifications are enabled. 

The issue is resolved. Now SAP Adapter does not keep redundant
references to request pipelines in notification objects.

WSP-867 (SAP_7.1_Fix9)
webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 routing notifications may send a
document to the wrong SAP system, when using the ALE, RFC or
BAPI transport.

When an SAP Adapter 7.1 routing notification receives a document
directly from an RFC listener, the ALE, RFC or BAPI transport
returns the document to the sending SAP system, instead of
sending it to the SAP system specified in the 'serverName'
transport parameter.

The issue is resolved. Routing notifications now always send
the document to the SAP system specified in the 'serverName'
transport parameter of the ALE, RFC or BAPI transport configured
for the notification.

WSP-855 (SAP_7.1_Fix9)
webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 inbound processing aborts with an
Integration Server session timeout when processing long-running
RFC requests.

When webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 is processing RFC requests over
a long period of time, the associated Integration Server sessions
may abort with a timeout.

The issue is resolved. The "watt.sap.listener.session.timeout"
parameter is now modified to prevent Integration Server session
timeouts when processing inbound RFC requests.

Changed Parameter Reference:
watt.sap.listener.session.timeout
The parameter has a new default value of “0”. When you use the
default value, webMethods Integration Server does not perform
Integration Server session timeout checks for inbound RFC
requests. The allowed minimum value is "0". 

WSP-849 (SAP_7.1_Fix9)
webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 does not stop an RFC Listener properly
if the shutdown sequence takes longer than three seconds.

webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 assumes that the shutdown sequence
of an RFC Listener does not take longer than 3 seconds and sets
the listener status to 'disabled' even when the underlying JCo
RFC has not yet finished its internal shutdown procedure. As a
result, SAP Adapter may not restart the RFC Listener
successfully.

The issue is resolved. webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 now has two
new server configuration parameters,
watt.sap.listener.start.timeout and watt.sap.listener.stop.timeout,
which you use to set waiting periods for the RFC Listener startup
and shutdown sequence.

New Parameter Reference:
watt.sap.listener.start.timeout
The number of seconds webMethods SAP Adapter will wait for the
RFC Listener startup to succeed before the adapter sets the
status of the RFC Listener to 'enabled' in Integration Server
Administrator. The default is "60" (seconds). The minimum value
is "0". When the value is set to "0", the adapter will wait
indefinitely for the RFC Listener to start.

watt.sap.listener.stop.timeout
The number of seconds webMethods SAP Adapter will wait for the
RFC Listener shutdown to succeed before the adapter sets the
status of the RFC Listener to 'disabled' in Integration Server
Administrator. The default value is "300" (seconds). The minimum
value is "0". When the value is set to "0", the adapter will wait
indefinitely for the RFC Listener to shutdown.

For information about setting Integration Server configuration
parameters, see "webMethods Integration Server Administrator's
Guide".

WSP-845 (SAP_7.1_Fix9)
webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 log messages do not provide enough
information about JCo and IDoc Library exceptions.

When the SAP JCo or the SAP IDoc Library throws an unexpected
generic exception, for example NullPointerException, webMethods
SAP Adapter 7.1 only logs a general error message.

The issue is resolved. The webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 log
messages now log the internal operation for which an unspecific
JCo or IDoc Library exception occurs.

WSP-851 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, the SAP_7.1_Fix8 fix sets the
log level of the SAP Adapter log component to 'Trace'.

The log level of webMethods SAP Adapter is set and modified only 
in the SAP Adapter user interface in Integration Server
Administrator. The log level of the Integration Server log
component 'SAP Adapter' must always be set to 'Trace', otherwise
the adapter log messages may be lost or not displayed completely.

The issue is resolved. webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 now sets the
log level of the 'SAP Adapter' Integration Server log component
automatically to 'Trace' whenever the log level is set or changed 
in the SAP Adapter user interface. 

WSP-834 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
webMethods SAP Adapter startup is delayed by SAP system logon
timeouts.

When the logon to one or more SAP systems fails due to a timeout,
the SAP Adapter startup can be delayed for several minutes.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter provides a new
configuration parameter, watt.sap.jco.clientConnectTimeout,
to set the JCo timeout for the logon to an SAP ABAP server.
Note: The new parameter does not prevent or shorten other
timeouts in the TCP/IP network layer, which occur when the
SAP System is not available.

watt.sap.jco.clientConnectTimeout
Set the JCo logon timeout (in seconds) after opening a technical
connection to an SAP system. For example, to set the logon
timeout to 5 seconds, specify:

    watt.sap.jco.clientConnectTimeout=5
    
The parameter has a default value of 60 (seconds) and a minimum
value of 1 (second). It has no maximum value.

For information about setting server configuration parameters and
working with extended settings, see Administering webMethods
Integration Server.

WSP-827 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
webMethods SAP Adapter transaction processing fails with
the following error: JCO_ERROR_REQUEST_CANCELLED.

During long-running SAP client calls, SAP Adapter may abort
the processing with a JCO_ERROR_REQUEST_CANCELLED error
message. The error occurs when JCo is checking for the
Integration Server session associated with the call,
but the Integration Server session has already timed out.
As a result, JCo aborts the client call to SAP with
an error. This can happen if you have a lengthy task, such as
sending out 10,000 IDocs, and the task takes longer than
the Integration Server session timeout. An easy and direct
solution would be to increase the watt.server.clientTimeout
parameter value (to perhaps 30 mins or more). However,
this might not be desirable in some installations.

This issue is resolved. When it is not desirable to increase
the value of watt.server.clientTimeout,
SAP Adapter provides a new configuration parameter,
watt.sap.rfc.callDuration. With the new parameter, you
prevent premature Integration Server session timeouts during
SAP client calls.

watt.sap.rfc.callDuration
Set the maximum duration of SAP client calls (in minutes)
directly so that the associated Integration Server session cannot
timeout and expire during the execution of an SAP client call.
For example, to set the call duration to 30 minutes, specify:

    watt.sap.rfc.callDuration=30
    
The parameter has a default value equal to the Integration
Server session timeout value as specified in
watt.server.clientTimeout. The minimum value of the parameter is
10 (minutes). There is no maximum value.

For information about setting server configuration parameters
and working with extended settings, see Administering webMethods
Integration Server.

WSP-814 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
webMethods SAP Adapter uses the wrong user context for SSO
Connections.

When creating SSO connections with the reserved user name
'$MYSAPSSO2$' in the pipeline $user variable, SAP Adapter does
not clear all internal JCo connection parameters. This behavior
causes JCo to assign the default RFC user to the new SSO
connection instead of the user provided in the logon ticket.

This issue is resolved. Now SAP Adapter opens new SSO
connections with the user provided in the SSO logon ticket.

WSP-808 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
In webMethods SAP Adapter, SAP table field appears as String when
creating SAP event listener notification.

When using SAP Adapter to create an event listener notification
for a SAP event containing a table field, the created
notification represents the table field as a string instead of a
stringList.

This issue is resolved. webMethods SAP Adapter now represents a
table field as a stringList when creating an event listener
notification. 

WSP-806 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
webMethods SAP Adapter does not release all locked adapter
connections.

When passing either empty strings or values that are identical to
the default connection parameters in the $user, $client, or
$language input parameters of the pub.sap.client:lockSession
public service, SAP Adapter does not release the locked adapter
connections properly when calling pub.sap.client:releaseSession.

This issue is resolved. Now SAP Adapter releases locked
connections for all $user, $client, and $language input parameter
settings.

WSP-796 (SAP_7.1_Fix8)
In webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1, qRFC and inbound queue processing
is not supported.

SAP Adapter cannot process inbound IDocs sent with qRFC. SAP
Adapter 6.5 supports qRFC, but version 7.1 aborts the qRFC
processing with the error message: "IDOC_ERROR_NO_QUEUE_HANDLER: 
The provided handler implementation cannot handle queued IDocs
properly. Make sure to implement a JCoQueuedIDocHandler."

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter 7.1 can now process inbound
qRFC transactions and it supports first-in-first-out processing
for multiple inbound IDoc queues. You must install the SAP IDoc
Library version 3.0.8 (or higher) to support inbound queue
processing.

WSP-794 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 does not support the reserved user
name '$MYSAPSSO2$' that was used in SAP Adapter 6.5 for single
sign on (SSO) to the SAP System.

In SAP Adapter 6.5, when the reserved user name '$MYSAPSSO2$' is
passed in the pipeline $user variable, SAP Adapter uses the
password (passed in the $pass variable) as a SSO ticket for the
RFC connection to the SAP System. However, SAP Adapter 7.1 does
not support this SSO logon mechanism.

This issue is resolved. Now SAP Adapter 7.1 supports the
'$MYSAPSSO2$' user name for SSO logon to SAP Systems.

WSP-781 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
In webMethods SAP Adapter, the pub.sap.transaction:list
public service returns all transactions when the state is set to
"Rolled back".

Calling the SAP Adapter's pub.sap.transaction:list service with
the "state" input parameter set to "Rolled back" returns
all transactions instead of only the rolled-back transactions.
The issue occurs because the state description was changed
from "Rolled back" in SAP Adapter version 4.6 to "Rolledback"
in adapter versions 6.5 and 7.1.

This issue is resolved. Now the pub.sap.transaction:list service
returns only rolled-back transactions when the "state" input
parameter is set to "Rolled back".

WSP-778 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
ALEListenerNotification document type is not conforming to the
IDOC structure on SAP

In webMethods SAP Adapter, the ALE Listener Notification document
type does not conform to the IDoc structure.

The publishable document type of an asynchronous ALE Listener
Notification in SAP Adapter has all the fields and segments set
as mandatory when the IDoc type has an extended name, for example
/IRM/AGRMNTS01. This can cause the failure of inbound IDoc
processing with the following error message:
"Error: [ISS.0098.9007] Data does not conform to the Publishable
Document Type."

This issue is resolved. The publishable document type of
asynchronous ALE Listener Notifications now conforms to the
IDoc structure for both standard and extended IDoc type names. 

WSP-773 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
In webMethods SAP Adapter, executing the Transaction Sweep
service may block tRFC processing and cause RFC connections to
be exhausted.

The SAP Adapter transaction store is blocked during the execution
of the pub.sap.transaction:sweep service. All other transaction
operations have to wait until the Transaction Sweep service ends.
This behavior can cause the exhaustion of RFC connections in the
connection pool and errors when starting RFC adapter services
under high load.

This issue is resolved. Now the pub.sap.transaction:sweep service
does not block the SAP Adapter transaction store.

WSP-765 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
In webMethods SAP Adapter, after invoking the
pub.sap.idoc:encodeString service, it runs in an endless loop.

The SAP Adapter pub.sap.idoc:encodeString service runs in an
endless loop when an empty IDoc without segments is passed as an
input. This issue gets cleared only after restarting Integration
Server.

The issue is resolved. The pub.sap.idoc:encodeString service does
not run in an endless loop when an empty IDoc without segments is
passed as input.

WSP-755 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
The webMethods SAP Adapter pub.sap.client:sendIDoc built-in
service does not use the $queueName input parameter.

The pub.sap.client:sendIDoc public service ignores the $queueName
input parameter, which makes it impossible to send an IDoc to a
specific IDoc inbound queue in the receiving SAP system.

This issue is resolved. The pub.sap.client:sendIDoc service now
acknowledges the $queueName input parameter and sends IDocs to
specific inbound queues by passing the name of the IDoc inbound
queue in the $queueName parameter.

WSP-750 (SAP_7.1_Fix7)
webMethods SAP Adapter cannot initialize Centralized Transaction
Store (CTS) on Integration Server 8.0.1 and higher.

When starting SAP Adapter on Integration Server version 8.0.1
and higher, an SAP Adapter instance configured as a CTS client
fails to connect to the CTS server instance with the following
error message:
"Error - ..pub.remote:invoke - java.net.ConnectException:
Connection refused" unreachable:".

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter configured as a CTS client
can now connect to the CTS server on all supported Intergation
Server versions.

WSP-747 (SAP_7.1_Fix6)
SNC connections cannot be configured as poolable.

SNC enabled RFC connections cannot be made poolable with the SAP
Adapter 7.1. This user interface (UI) restriction was carried
over from previous SAP Adapter versions that relied on JCo
version 2. SAP Adapter 7.1 uses JCo 3, which allows connection
pooling for SNC enabled connections; therefore, the restriction
is no longer necessary.

This issue is resolved. SNC enabled RFC client connections can
now be configured as poolable in the SAP Adapter 7.1 UI. 

WSP-743 (SAP_7.1_Fix6)
SNC connections cannot be enabled after installation of
SAP_7.1_Fix5.

After installing webMethods SAP Adapter fix SAP_7.1_Fix5,
attempts to enable RFC SNC connections fail, resulting in a
java.lang.NullPointerException being thrown during preparation of
the SNC connection.

This issue is resolved. SNC connections can now be enabled
successfully.

WSP-736 (SAP_7.1_Fix5)
SAP Adapter notification throws "Type mismatch, String expected"
error.

SAP Adapter asynchronous RFC notifications cannot publish
incoming documents to the Broker, and abort with the error
message "Type mismatch, String expected" if RFC tables consist
of single CHAR or STRING fields. This issue is caused by the
SAP Adapter storing such tables in Object arrays instead of
String arrays, as expected by the Integration Server's document
validation.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter can now publish RFC tables
consisting of single CHAR and STRING fields to the Broker.

WSP-711 (SAP_7.1_Fix5)
SAP Adapter transaction processing fails with error
JCO_ERROR_REQUEST_CANCELLED.

During long running SAP transactions, SAP Adapter may abort the
processing with a JCO_ERROR_REQUEST_CANCELLED error message.
This behavior occurs when JCo is checking for an Integration
Server session timeout, and the total processing time of the
transaction exceeds the time specified by the
watt.server.clientTimeout server configuration parameter.
This issue occurs because in JCo 3.0.6., SAP has reduced the
session check interval. Therefore, if you have a lengthy task,
such as sending out 10,000 IDocs, it is possible that the task
takes longer than the Integration Server session timeout. For
older JCo versions, this condition is 'unnoticed'. But with the
earlier check in JCo 3.0.6, this can result in the issue
described here. An easy and direct solution would be to increase
the watt.server.clientTimeout value accordingly (to perhaps 30
mins or more); however, this may not be desirable in some
installations.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter does not abort long running
SAP transactions for an Integration Server session timeout, but
it logs a message in the server's error log.
To accomplish this, SAP Adapter now automatically sets the JCo
property "jco.session_timeout.check_interval" to the same default
value (10 min.) as in previous JCo3 versions before 3.0.6.

Additionally, two new server configuration parameters,
watt.sap.jco.timeout and watt.sap.listener.session.timeout, have
been added. watt.sap.jco.timeout sets the JCo timeout check
interval for RFC client connections, whereas
watt.sap.listener.session.timeout sets the timeout for
Integration Server sessions created by the SAP Adapter to process
incoming RFC documents. Use these new parameters when it is not
desirable to increase the value of watt.server.clientTimeout.

  watt.sap.jco.timeout allows you to set the global JCo session
  timeout check interval (in minutes) directly so that
  Integration Server session timeout checks do not occur too
  early. For example, to set the timeout to 30 minutes, specify:

    watt.sap.jco.timeout=30

  watt.sap.listener.session.timeout allows you to set a global
  session timeout value (in minutes) for all RFC listener
  sessions so that Integration Server session timeouts do not
  occur too early for lengthy RFC inbound processing tasks. For
  example, to set the RFC listener session timeout to 1 day
  (24*60 minutes), specify:

    watt.sap.listener.session.timeout=1440

see Administering webMethods Integration Server (webMethods
Integration Server Administrator's Guide).

WSP-710 (SAP_7.1_Fix5)
SAP Adapter transaction processing fails with "session ID does
not exist" error.

During long running SAP transactions, SAP Adapter may abort the
processing with a "...Session with session ID {0} does not
exist..." error message. This behavior occurs when JCo is
checking for an Integration Server session timeout, and the total
processing time of the transaction exceeds the time specified by
the watt.server.clientTimeout server configuration parameter.
This issue occurs because in JCo 3.0.6., SAP has reduced the
session check interval. Therefore, if you have a lengthy task,
such as sending out 10,000 IDocs, it is possible that the task
takes longer than the Integration Server session timeout. For
older JCo versions, this condition is 'unnoticed'. But with the
earlier check in JCo 3.0.6, this can result in the issue
described here. An easy and direct solution would be to increase
the watt.server.clientTimeout value accordingly (to perhaps 30
mins or more); however, this may not be desirable in some
installations.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter does not abort long running
SAP transactions for an Integration Server session timeout, but
it logs a message in the server's error log. To accomplish this,
SAP Adapter now automatically sets the JCo property
"jco.session_timeout.check_interval" to the same default value
(10 min.) as in previous JCo3 versions before 3.0.6.

Additionally, a new server configuration parameter,
watt.sap.jco.timeout, has been added. Use this new parameter when
it is not desirable to increase the value of
watt.server.clientTimeout. The new watt.sap.jco.timeout parameter
allows you to set the global JCo session timeout check interval
directly so that Integration Server session timeout checks do
not occur too early. For example, to set the timeout to
30 minutes, specify:

  watt.sap.jco.timeout=30

For information about setting server configuration parameters,
see Administering webMethods Integration Server (webMethods
Integration Server Administrator's Guide).

WSP-706 (SAP_7.1_Fix5)
SAP Adapter throws "Access denied to invoke..." exceptions when
accessing the CTS server.

When SAP Adapter is configured as a Centralized Transaction Store
(CTS) client and when it is processing many listener threads in
parallel, the CTS transaction updates may be blocked with "Access
denied to invoke on remote server..." messages in the server.log
file.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter now uses a dedicated
Integration Server session for all remote CTS transaction updates
to avoid the "Access denied..." exceptions.

WSP-701, WSP-702 (SAP_7.1_Fix5)
Routing notification throws null pointer exception when receiving
a document.

After migration of a SAP Adapter routing notification, the
notification may throw null pointer exceptions when receiving and
processing incoming documents. This behavior is caused by the
Adapter Runtime (ART) and is related to resolved issue PIEAR-194.

This issue is resolved. Migrated routing notifications no longer
throw null pointer exceptions, but display an error log entry
instead. Requirement is that the latest IS_Core fix for supported
Integration Server versions in which issue PIEAR-194 was resolved
must also be installed. The resolution for PIEAR-194 added three
new services and one new watt parameter. Using these services and
setting the watt parameter, you can update associated listener
notifications for a listener and you can log the data to analyze
whether listeners and listener notifications are correctly
linked.

See the IS_Core fix readme file for complete information about
the new services and the watt parameter.

WSP-700 (SAP_7.1_Fix5)
Developer cannot create SAP Document Types.

After a long period of Integration Server inactivity (for
example, 3 to 4 hours), SAP Adapter 7.1 fails under certain
conditions to provide valid repository connections for metadata
lookups. This behavior can cause Developer to either hang or to
 display an empty 'SAP System ID' selection list when creating
SAP Document Types. This 'System ID' information is also missing
in the SAP Repository Connection Pools section of the SAP Adapter
Monitoring screen. The issue is caused by a bug in the current
SAP JCo, including version 3.0.7.

This issue is resolved. SAP Document Types can be now be created
after long periods of inactivity without hang ups or an empty
'SAP System ID' selection list.

WSP-685 (SAP_7.1_Fix4)
Integration Server runs out of threads when configured as a
CTS server.

The SAP Adapter Central Transaction Store (CTS) implementation
uses standard Integration Server Remote Server calls to
communicate between CTS clients and the CTS server. Periodically,
CTS clients send their "heartbeat" status to the CTS server.
These calls are causing the server to exhaust all available
threads and become unresponsive over time.

The issue is caused by a change in the signature of the public
service wm.server.remote:invoke, which is used by all CTS
clients. Starting with Integration Server 7.1.3, this service
requires a new parameter, $clusterRetry, to be set to avoid
automatic Remote Server call redirection on clustered Integration
Servers. If this parameter is not set properly, CTS client calls
can result in an endless recursion that uses up all Integration
Server threads.

The issue is resolved. SAP Adapter now sets the $clusterRetry
parameter for all calls to wm.server.remote:invoke to avoid
automatic Remote Server call redirection.

WSP-683 (SAP_7.1_Fix4)
While processing large numbers of inbound IDocs, the maximum
session limit is reached after some are processed, but remaining
IDocs are not processed and appear to be lost.

When the SAP system sends a large number of IDOCs (for example,
30k or more) to the Integration Server, the server processes some
(10-11k), but soon reaches the maximum number of allowed sessions
limit. At that point the remaining IDocs are lost without being
processed. This behavior occurs because SAP Adapter sessions
exceed the Integration Server maximum licensed sessions limit
during high tRFC load. The issue is due to an inconsistency of
the state information update for JCo3 stateless servers. JCo does
not properly report session-has-ended events for such servers.
This has the effect that Integration Server Sessions opened for
the tRFC processing can not be closed after the processing had
ended, thus causing IS Session overflow for high-volume tRFC
processing.

The issue is resolved. SAP Adapter now uses stateful JCo servers
which allow SAP Adapter to close IS Sessions immediately after
tRFC processing has ended, and avoid IS Session overload.

WSP-677 (SAP_7.1_Fix4)
webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 with Fix3 is partially loaded if SAP
connections fail during startup.

After applying SAP_7.1_Fix3, SAP Adapter 7.1 package, WmSAP, is
only partially loaded if one of the RFC connections fails to
initialize.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter 7.1 now loads successfully
and gives a warning message for each failed connection during
startup.

WSP-676 (SAP_7.1_Fix4)
Cannot start an RFC Listener that requires a SAP Router string.

When used with SAP Adapter 7.1, RFC Listeners that require a SAP
router string cannot be started. This behavior occurs because SAP
Adapter 7.1 does not allow for specifying a SAP Router String for
RFC Listeners. This prevents RFC Listeners from connecting to SAP
systems that are behind a firewall.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter 7.1 now uses the SAP Router
String definition set in the RFC Connection also for the RFC
Listeners connecting to the same SAP host. This enables RFC
Listeners to connect to SAP host systems behind a firewall.

WSP-663 (SAP_7.1_Fix3)
New Integration Server connections rejected with many expired SAP
Adapter sessions being restored.

On Integration IS 7.1.2 and higher, the scheduled JCo session
checking causes expired Integration Server sessions to be
reloaded from the cluster store. This behavior causes the server
to reject new connections because the maximum number of licensed
sessions has been exceeded. This behavior is due to the JCo
AutoJobRunner permanently restoring expired sessions.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter does not restore expired
sessions.

WSP-656 (SAP_7.1_Fix3)
Cannot create SAP Document Type in Developer.

In webMethods Developer, when creating a new SAP Document Type,
Developer either hangs or displays an empty 'SAP System ID'.
Depending on the number of currently open connections and
listeners, this behavior occurs because SAP Adapter 7.1 fails
under certain conditions to provide valid repository connections
for metadata lookups.

This issue is resolved. SAP Document Types can be now be created
successfully in Developer.

WSP-646 (SAP_7.1_Fix3)
Metadata lookup errors occur during SAP Adapter processing.

SAP Adapter 7.1 uses common repository connections for all RFC
connections to SAP systems with the same system id. Under certain
conditions, the adapter prematurely deletes repository
connections
while there is a still an open RFC connection that depends on the
deleted repository connection. When the adapter deletes the
repository connections, metadata lookup exceptions like
"IDOC_ERROR_METADATA_UNAVAILABLE: The metadata for the IDoc type
is unavailable." occur.

This issue is resolved. SAP Adapter now deletes repository
connections only after all dependent RFC connections have been
closed, and processing completes without metadata lookup errors.

WSP-637 (SAP_7.1_Fix2)
SAP Adapter listener notification (remote event/receiver
coupling) fails to publish notification document.

After creating a remote event/receiver coupling listener
notification, there is an error publishing the notification
document. The following error is thrown:
pathName=/_env/activation errorCode=VV-005 errorMessage=
[ISC.0082.9034] Field is absent, field must exist.
In addition, the adapter notification document shows all envelope
fields (under _env) as required; however, the envelope fields
should all be optional, as with any other adapter notification.
Looking at pub.publish:envelope (which is part of the WmPublic
package.), all the fields of this envelope document are also
changed to required. Restarting the Integration Server causes all
these _env fields to change back to optional.

This issue is resolved. Notification documents can be published
without error when creating or changing a remote event/receiver
coupling adapter notification, and the pub.publish:envelope
document type is not altered.

WSP-631 (SAP_7.1_Fix2)
SAP Adapter sometimes incorrectly creates IDoc SDATA strings
that are longer than 1000 characters.

For IDocs sent from SAP Unicode systems, the built-in service
‘pub.sap.idoc:encodeSDATA’ sometimes incorrectly creates SDATA
strings that are longer than 1000 characters and with invalid
field lengths.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-629 (SAP_7.1_Fix2)
SAP Adapter 4.6 routing rule migrated by the migration utility
to SAP Adapter 6.5 or SAP Adapter 7.1 contains the wrong Service
Name in the resulting routing notification.

During migration from SAP Adapter 4.6 version to 6.5 version or
7.1 version, the migration utility converts WmPartners routing
rules to SAP Adapter 6.5 or 7.1 routing notifications,
respectively. However, after the migration completes, the new
routing notification is not invoking the correct service.
Looking at the new routing notification, the Adapter Settings
tab's "Service Invoke" field contains a different service than
the service defined on the original routing rule.

This issue occurs because the migration utility, when migrating
routing rules, is expecting that routing rules will have an
outbound transport type of "B2B Service." However it appears that
some older versions of the SAP Adapter did set this value to
"Service".

This issue is resolved. The migration utility now checks for both
values, "B2B Service" and "Service", during routing rule
migration.

WSP-623 (SAP_7.1_Fix2)
While viewing the transactions in the transactions store, SAP
Adapter blocks the processing of the tRFC calls.

While viewing the content of the transactions in the Transactions
page, SAP Adapter blocks the processing of all inbound and
outbound tRFC calls. If the transaction store contains large
number of transactions, then the blockage time sometimes extends
to several minutes.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-621 (SAP_7.1_Fix2)
SAP Adapter does not support RFC Changing Parameters.

webMethods SAP Adapter 7.1 does not display RFC Changing
Parameters in the RFC Lookup screen or in the signature of
RFC Adapter Services. Additionally, the adapter does not allow
any Changing Parameters to pass when executing RFCs.

The issue is resolved. SAP Adapter now displays all Changing
Parameters in the RFC Lookup and in RFC Adapter Service
signatures, and it passes Changing Parameters to the executed RFC
and returns the modified values.

WSP-605 (SAP_7.1_Fix2)
After migrating from SAP Adapter 6.5 SP1 to SAP Adapter 7.1, RFC
notifications with changing parameters do not work.

After migrating from SAP Adapter 6.5 SP1 to SAP Adapter 7.1, RFC
notifications with changing parameters do not work. This issue
occurs because the SAP Adapter 7.1 does not transfer the inbound
data of changing RFC parameters to the associated RFC
notifications.

This issue is resolved. Now, after migrating from SAP Adapter 6.5
SP1 to SAP Adapter 7.1, RFC notifications with changing
parameters work as expected.

WSP-611 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
The "." (dot) character in IDoc field-name causes invalid
document structure.

If an RFC or IDoc field name contains the "." (dot) character,
webMethods SAP Adapter creates a document type with an invalid
hierarchical structure for the RFC or IDoc document. This issue
occurs because ART limits the use of the "." (dot) character
to separate different document-type nesting levels.

This issue is resolved. Now, SAP Adapter substitutes all "."
(dot) characters in RFC and IDoc field names with the "|" (pipe)
character to avoid hierarchy issues in the document that
ART creates.

WSP-602 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
pub.sap.encodeString service fails with "Index greater than
number of IDoc fields" error.

The public service pub.sap.encodeString fails with an "Index
greater than number of IDoc fields" error message when the IDoc
input parameter contains segments with empty fields.

This issue is resolved. The public service pub.sap.encodeString
now successfully processes IDocs with partially empty segments
without errors.

WSP-597 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
SAP Adapter does not work with SAP JCo 3.0.3 or higher.

SAP JCo and IDoc Library version 3.0.3 and higher are
incompatible with the previous versions and therefore cause SAP
Adapter runtime exceptions when processing IDocs or performing
RFC Repository lookups.

The issue is resolved. SAP Adapter is now compatible with SAP JCo
and IDoc Library version 3.0.3 and higher. Important: The
previous JCo releases 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 are no longer supported.

WSP-596 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
pub.sap.idoc:decodeString creates invalid fields for
unicode SAP Systems

When calling public service pub.sap.idoc:decodeString for an
unicode SAP system, the fields within the data-part of each IDoc
segment are populated with invalid data.

The issue is resolved, pub.sap.idoc:decodeString now extracts the
data for the segment fields properly for unicode SAP Systems.

WSP-579 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
Defined event-receiver couplings do not work with SAP
Process Monitoring Agent 8.0.

The SAP Process Monitoring Agent component of webMethods Optimize
for SAP uses the "WMBAM" receiver type prefix. However, this
prefix is not compatible with SAP Process Monitoring Agent 8.0,
which expects the prefix to be "WMBEM." Therefore, previously
defined couplings do not work.

This issue is resolved. A new configuration parameter
"watt.sap.rectype.prefix" has been added to allow the receiver
type prefix to be set.

To set the receiver type prefix:

1. From the Integration Server Administrator, click Settings >
   Extended.

2. Click Edit Extended Settings. In the Extended Settings editor,
   type the following:

   watt.sap.rectype.prefix=WMBAM

   Note: The parameter name is case sensitive.

3. Click Save Changes. A key for the new property appears in the
   Extended Settings list.

4. Click Show and Hide Keys. You will see
   "watt.sap.rectype.prefix" listed as a Key and is visible.

5. Restart the webMethods Integration Server for the changes to
   take effect.

For more information about the server configuration and the
server.cnf file, see the guide "Administering webMethods
Integration Server."

WSP-414 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
Events from business object with several keyfields are not
processed by the SAP Process Monitoring Agent.

Business objects instances are uniquely identified by their
keyfields, but they might consist of more than one keyfield. In
the case of multiple keyfields, the SAP Adapter does not process
the notification, and instead returns the following error:

java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError - WmSAP Adapter: Error on
creating new Object: com.wm.adapter.sap.bo.BOInstanceEvent

The issue is resolved. Events for business objects with more than
one keyfield are now processed correctly.

WSP-412 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
IDocs cannot be sent to SAP Adapter when configured for
Central Transaction Store.

SAP Adapter returns the error message "User session required to
invoke a protected remote server" to the sending SAP System when
the adapter is configured to use a Centralized Transaction Store
(CTS). This behavior occurs because SAP Adapter, which uses the
Integration Server Remote Invoke mechanism to communicate with
the CTS, does not always provide a valid IS Session.

This issue is resolved. The Invoke State of the Remote Invokes
now always contains a valid IS Session to prevent access denials,
and SAP Adapter now receives and processes IDocs sent from SAP
when configured to use a CTS.

WSP-411 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
Local Function Module WM_PUSH_EVENT cannot be accessed

Creating an adapter notification for the predefined function
module WM_PUSH_EVENT or looking up WM_PUSH_EVENT in the SAP
Adapter GUI results in the following error: [SAP.105.9205] WmSAP
Adapter: Function interface named 'WM_PUSH_EVENT' does not exist
on SAP system with system id 'E60'

The issue is resolved. Notifications for WM_PUSH_EVENT can be
created without errors.

WSP-407 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
IDocs sent from SAP to webMethods have invalid date/time fields
in the DC40 header.

For IDocs sent to webMethods, the date and time format
(represented by the CREDAT and CRETIM fields) in the EDI_DC40
header record shows with dashes. This behavior occurs because the
IDoc header fields CREDAT and CRETIM are not represented
consistently within webMethods.

This issue is resolved. The IDoc header is now decoded correctly
using the proper format for dates and times. Specifically, IDocs
can be represented at the webMethods platform in four different
layouts: iDocList object, IDOC tables, document, and flat file
string.

- For iDocList object and IDOC tables, header fields CREDAT and
  CRETIM are now formatted using the 10 resp 8 character length
  ISO extended format. That is: CREDAT is shown as YYYY-MM-DD and
  CRETIM is shown as hh:mm:ss.

- For document and flat file string, header fields CREDAT and
  CRETIM are formatted using the 8 resp 6 character length SAP
  format. That is: CREDAT is shown as YYYYMMDD and CRETIM is
  shown as hhmmss.

WSP-398 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
$abapexception not filled properly.

WmSAP_6-5_SP1_Fix17 causes pub.sap.transport.BAPI:OutboundProcess
to not pass BAPI exception data properly to output parameter
$abapexception in case of an ABAP or BAPI exception.

The issue is resolved. The service now transfers all exception
data to output parameter $abapexception.

WSP-395 (SAP_7.1_Fix1)
pub.sap.transport.BAPI:OutboundProcess throws
NullPointerException.

The public service pub.sap.transport.BAPI:OutboundProcess throws
a NullPointerException if the BAPI does not exist in the target
SAP system.

The issue is resolved. The service now creates an error messages
when the BAPI does not exist.
