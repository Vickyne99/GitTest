<CENTER><H3>webMethods ACH Module Version 6.1</H3></CENTER>

<p>
webMethods is pleased to introduce the webMethods ACH Module 6.1.
Built on top of the webMethods Integration Server,
the webMethods ACH Module enables financial institutions
to participate in the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.
The ACH network is a nationwide batch-oriented,
electronic funds system that is governed by rules
established by the National Automated Clearing House Association
(NACHA) standards.
The ACH network provides a way to process payments with
electronic transactions, replacing paper payments.
</P>

<p>
The webMethods ACH Module enables financial institutions to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Originate electronic payments by sending electronic
payments described in an ACH file
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
Receive and process electronic payments described in an ACH file
</li>
</ul>


<H3>Sending and Receiving Electronic Payments</H3>
<P>The ACH Module enables you to send and receive payments electronically.
You can use the ACH Module to create ACH files from data provided
by other systems connected to the Integration Server
and then forward those ACH files to the ACH network.
</p>
<p>
When receiving electronic payments,
the webMethods ACH Module receives an ACH file and processes it,
making the data available to other systems connected to the Integration Server.
</P>

<H3>Routing and Storing ACH Files</H3>
<p>
The ACH Module enables you to route and store ACH files using
a file system, custom services, or webMethods Trading Networks.
This feature provides a centralized persistence store of all ACH files.
You can save, delete, or track messages from the persistence store.
</p>

<H3>Customizing Your Configuration</H3>
<p>
You can customize the configuration settings in the ACH Module
directly from a user interface provided in the Integration Server Administrator.
</p>

<H3>Tracking Stored ACH Files</H3>
<p>
The ACH Module enables you to track stored ACH files from the
ACH Module persistence store.
You can view and track stored messages from the ACH Home page,
which is provided with the webMethods ACH Module.
